### Overview

This repository provides code, exercises and solutions for popular Reinforcement Learning algorithms. These are meant to serve as a learning tool to complement the theoretical materials from

- [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition)](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/bookdraft2017june.pdf)
- [David Silver's Reinforcement Learning Course](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html)

Each folder in corresponds to one or more chapters of the above textbook and/or course. In addition to exercises and solution, each folder also contains a list of learning goals, a brief concept summary, and links to the relevant readings.

All code is written in Python 3 and uses RL environments from [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/). Advanced techniques use [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for neural network implementations.
